They are much larger and bulkier than their predecessors, and attack with devastating hydraulic fists.\n\nTheir increased size is also their primary weakness, as they are unable to fit into the narrow tunnels and doorways of the dungeon. The dwarves were able to compensate for the DM-200's lack of mobility by allowing them to vent their toxic exhaust fumes at distant enemies, or enemies they cannot reach.

The DM-201 is a retrofitted DM-200 which acts as a sentry turret that has no movement ability. In exchange for the lack of mobility, DM-201s have significantly more durability and attacking power.\n\nAs DM-201s have no engine to vent exhaust from, the dwarves instead outfitted them with corrosive gas grenades! DM-201s are careful with these grenades however, and will only lob them when attacked from a distance.

actors.mobs.yogdzewa.desc=Yog-Dzewa is an Old God; a great monstrosity which reaches into mortal worlds and devours them to fuel its endless growth.

Instead it has created avatars and summoned demonic minions to do its bidding here.\n\nThis giant eye is the focal point of Yog-Dzewa's power in this world. While the eye itself is immobile, it is capable of shooting powerful beams of demonic magic and summoning a variety of minions to aid it.
