journal.document.labs_medic.title=Records from the Laboratory
journal.document.labs_medic.suspicious.title=Suspicious Signs
journal.document.labs_medic.suspicious.body=July 14, 2274.\n\nI am Morale Lieutenant, an officer of the space mercenary fleet.\n\nCurrently, we are preparing to dimension jump to the planet Tyres for our next mission. The inhabitants of this planet have been suffering from continuous invasions from other planets, and our fleet is approaching with supplies, medical support, and more.\n\nThe captain of this fleet, Jimmy Lane, ordered to charge the FTL drive for the dimension jump while calling the researchers and starting to laugh to himself.\n\nSomething seems off. Is he planning something different during the dimension jump?\n\nI feel it's necessary to record this. The dimension jump is scheduled to start tomorrow. Before that, I need to keep an eye on what the captain is up to.
journal.document.labs_medic.evidence.title=Evidence
journal.document.labs_medic.evidence.body=July 15, 2274.\n\nContinuously watching the captain, I witnessed him holding something like a map with coordinates and constantly checking the direction around the ship.\n\nHe was looking in a direction completely different from where the planet Tyres is located, and I sensed something was amiss. Could he be planning to jump elsewhere?\n\nBut I'm not certain yet. I need a bit more solid evidence.\n\nThough we're paid to do our job, I have a duty to alleviate the suffering of citizens. If we jump to somewhere other than Tyres, the people there will continue to suffer. I can't allow that to happen.\n\n...But the dimension jump is just a few hours away now, and I need to intervene before it's too late!
journal.document.labs_medic.rebel.title=Rebellion
journal.document.labs_medic.rebel.body=I repeatedly asked the captain if we were heading in the right direction, but he just kept insisting that we were. That bastard, he's hiding something.\n\nI snatched the map he had tucked in his coat pocket and yelled, "Is this still right!?"\n\nEveryone in the bridge was startled by my voice, and the captain, taken aback, soon pointed a gun at me. Don't push it, I'm armed too.\n\nAnticipating this situation, I also pulled out a medical gamma-ray emitter. It may seem weak on the surface, but a wrong shot could cause cellular mutation to a lethal degree, just as deadly as a gun.\n\nThe map is with me now, and I stand on equal footing with the captain. Now, spill the beans peacefully!
journal.document.labs_medic.truth.title=Truth
journal.document.labs_medic.truth.body=He seemed to realize his disadvantage and began to speak up. We were planning not a spatial but a temporal jump, and during the jump, we would retrieve the last piece of some amulet from a certain point.\n\nWhat's a stupid amulet compared to forsaking dying citizens? Whether we go back to the past or to the future, those people are bound to suffer!\n\nHe shrugged and then told me to calm down, lowering his gun. According to him, the amulet holds near-omnipotent power. With it, one can heal the dying and create whatever material they desire.\n\nDo you believe such nonsense? I shouted. But in my excitement, I failed to notice the approaching guards from behind and was soon apprehended without resistance.\n\nAh, are they about to lose hope just like this...?
journal.document.labs_medic.almighty_power.title=Almighty Power
journal.document.labs_medic.almighty_power.body=He instructed me to observe carefully what he was doing and then locked me up in a cell visible from the bridge.\n\nThe erroneous dimensional jump... No, time jump was executed, and as it ended, he held a gem emitting light in his hand.\n\nWe soon landed on some planet, and as he inserted the final gem into the amulet, a surreal power enveloped him visibly.\n\nWith a big grin, he slowly walked towards my cell and told me to watch out the window.\n\nThen, the ship that was in the sky teleported to the space, and then teleported to where the planet Tyres was visible. And then it returned to where it originally was. He even poured out a multitude of medical supplies into the void.\n\nIt was like witnessing magic. With such power, couldn't one save the world...?
journal.document.labs_medic.salvation.title=Salvation
journal.document.labs_medic.salvation.body=2278... Actually, I don't even know what time it is now.\n\nHe promised me that once he thoroughly studies the power of the amulet and achieves full power, he will save the world. And as someone with no other options, I had no choice but to comply with his words.\n\nAlthough he seems to be lying, the power of the amulet was real, and someday, I will intercept that relic and truly save the world.\n\nIf only I could handle the forces in this lab, I might be able to escape, but there's too much for me to handle alone.\n\nWith hope alone, I've lived under him for years, and today, suddenly, chaos erupted.\n\nEmergency lights were on throughout the lab, and riot troops and tanks were moving flawlessly.\n\nI heard that some heavily armed guy is single-handedly wrecking the entire army, and now's the chance. I need to get out of here!

journal.document.adventurers_guide.gun.title=Guns
journal.document.adventurers_guide.gun.body=In this dungeon, the gun can be seen throughout the dungeon under the influence of any event. The gun can be fired after being equipped, and when the magazine is empty, it can be loaded(using ammunitions) and fired again.\n\nThe quick slot allows you to handle guns conveniently and reload quickly without using up all the magazines. Try firing the gun into your own location.\n\nBullets can be sometimes obtained from dungeons, but you can also make and use them yourself with liquid metal made from the Alchemy Pot by melting the thrown weapon. Making a bullet belt will give you more bullets!\n\nUpgrading the gun also increases the bullet performance, but the effect of the Ring of Sharpshooting does not significantly affect the bullet.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.gunsmithing.title=Gun Modification
journal.document.adventurers_guide.gunsmithing.body=Alchemy allows you to create a gunsmithing tool that allows you to modify the guns you have as you wish!\n\nGun modifications grants various changes to guns, and they can be freely modified and used depending on your current situation.\n\nGun modifications include barrel modifications, magazine modifications, bullet modifications, weight modifications, attachments modifications, magic modifications, etc.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.bow.title=Bows
journal.document.adventurers_guide.bow.body=Bow is a ranged weapon that can be used instead of a gun. If you find a bow in the dungeon, you can equip it and use it.\n\nBows, unlike firearms, do not have magazines, and each time they are fired, they use up the ammunition you have to fire arrows. Arrows are sometimes pinned to enemies or dropped on the ground in a reusable form.\n\nArrows have a lower amount of damage compared to guns, but you can expect a higher amount of damage when you do sneak attack to the enemy.\n\nThe melee attack power of the bow itself is very low, so it's a very unfavorable weapon for melee combat. Melee attack with bow often pushes the enemy out, granting you to make some distance to fire arrows. If you need to make distance certainly, try a sneak attack.\n\nUpgrading the bow also increases the arrow performance, but the effect of the Ring of Sharpshooting does not significantly affect the arrow.
journal.document.adventurers_guide.blueprint.title=Blueprints
journal.document.adventurers_guide.blueprint.body=Magical blueprints are one of the great choice in weapon upgrading. You can make blueprints that contain information about specific weapons via alchemy.\n\nBlueprints have a preset recipe. You can create blueprints with two weapons that fit the recipe and unstable evolution, or one weapon that fits the recipe, upgrade dust, and unstable evolution.\n\nThere is a success rate in using a blueprint, and the lower the tier of weapon you use compared to the weapon the blueprint contains, the lower the probability. You can also upgrade the blueprint itself to increase the probability!
